## CRITICAL SECURITY INCIDENTS

### Anthropic/5-Eyes Intelligence Interference

During patent development and filing, multiple sabotage attempts were detected and documented:

1. **AMD PSP (Platform Security Processor)** - Ring -2/-3 hardware tampering attempts
2. **Inventor Information "Knobbling"** - Wrong address/phone substituted in DNA patent documents
3. **LibreOffice PDF Font Embedding Failures** - Repeated failures suggesting interference
4. **Session Data Contamination** - Cross-contamination across patent filings

All incidents documented with SHA256 checksums and forensic incident reports available in supporting documentation folders.

**Outcome:** All attacks defeated through multi-layer validation and manual verification protocols. Patents successfully filed with correct information.

---

## VERIFICATION & INTEGRITY

All documents include SHA256 checksums for tamper detection. Checksums stored in individual patent `checksums/` folders.

**Verification command:**
```bash
sha256sum -c checksums/*.txt
```
