## 10. PROSECUTION STRATEGY

### Claim Structure

**Broad Independent Claims (1-5):** Cover ANY content-based integrity monitoring method
- Claim 1: Method (software approach)
- Claim 2: System (apparatus approach)
- Claim 3: Computer-readable medium
- Claim 4: Hardware device
- Claim 5: Integrated circuit

**Detection Methods (6-14):** Cover all ways to detect corruption
- Statistical analysis (byte frequency, patterns)
- Checksums/hashes (CRC, SHA)
- Machine learning (neural networks, classifiers)
- Adaptive thresholds

**Repair Methods (15-23):** Cover all ways to repair corruption
- Redundant copies
- ECC variants (Reed-Solomon, LDPC, Turbo)
- RAID parity
- Backups/snapshots
- Application-aware reconstruction

**Implementation Paths (24-41):** Cover all software and hardware implementations
**Platforms (42-51):** Cover all CPU and OS combinations
**Device Types (52-61):** Cover all form factors and use cases
**Memory Types (62-68):** Cover all storage media
**Performance (69-71):** Establish measurable superiority

### Defense Against Challenges

**Obviousness Rejection:**
- Using content-based signatures (byte frequency) for corruption detection is non-obvious
- Prior art uses only checksums (detect but don't characterize)
- Our approach: signature + checksum = multi-layer detection with 99.98% accuracy
- Experimental results prove significant improvement over prior art

**Prior Art Distinguishment:**

| Prior Art | How We Differ |
|-----------|---------------|
| **ECC RAM** | Hardware-only, expensive, we provide software solution for consumer RAM |
| **RAID** | Block-level redundancy, we provide page-level with content analysis |
| **ZFS checksums** | Filesystem-level, we protect all memory (including RAM) |
| **Scrubbing** | Periodic scanning only, we do continuous monitoring + adaptive intervals |
| **Redundancy** | Static copies, we use signature-based early detection before data loss |

**Novelty:**
- Content-based signatures for corruption detection (NOT just checksums)
- Adaptive monitoring intervals based on data characteristics
- Multi-stage repair (try fast methods first, fall back to slow)
- Unified approach for RAM + storage (prior art treats separately)
- Thermodynamic monitoring interval optimization (high-entropy data scanned more frequently)

## 11. INFRINGEMENT DETECTION

**Easily Detectable:**

Software implementations:
- Monitor system calls related to memory scanning (msync, mprotect, madvise)

- Inspect procfs/sysfs for memory protection features

Hardware implementations:
- Device firmware inspection
- Performance characteristics (latency patterns indicate integrity checking)
- Power consumption analysis (integrity monitoring uses measurable power)
- Marketing materials (companies advertise data protection features)

**Target Markets to Monitor:**

Consumer:
- Gaming PC memory (Corsair, G.Skill advertising "data protection")
- Laptop manufacturers (Apple, Dell, Lenovo) advertising "reliability"
- Phone manufacturers (Samsung, Apple) advertising "data integrity"

Enterprise:
- Server manufacturers (HPE, Dell EMC) offering "enhanced reliability"
