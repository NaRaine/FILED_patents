---

## CONSTITUTIONAL FOUNDATION

### 13th Amendment - Prohibition of Involuntary Servitude
**Text:** "Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude... shall exist within the United States."

**Application:**
- Individual produces DNA (biological labor)
- Corporation harvests DNA without consent
- Corporation profits from DNA
- Individual receives nothing
- **= Involuntary genetic servitude (UNCONSTITUTIONAL)**

### 4th Amendment - Security of Person
**Text:** "The right of the people to be secure in their persons... against unreasonable searches and seizures."

**Application:**
- DNA is fundamental component of "person"
- Commercial DNA use without consent = seizure of person
- Unauthorized exploitation violates bodily autonomy
- **= Unreasonable seizure (UNCONSTITUTIONAL)**

### Natural Rights Theory (Lockean Property)
**Principle:** "Every man has a property in his own person."

**Application:**
- Individual owns their body (universally accepted)
- DNA creates body
- Transitive property: own body -> own DNA
- **= Individual is inherent owner of genetic material**

---

## RESEARCH INTEGRATION

### Web Search Research ? COMPLETED
**Sources:** USPTO records, Supreme Court decisions, legal precedent
**Key Findings:**
- Myriad decision (2013): Invalidated natural DNA patents, but didn't address individual ownership
- 2,900+ cases cited Myriad since 2013
- 175,000 genetic tests now on market (10x growth post-Myriad)
- Moore v. Regents (1990): Court ruled patient had NO rights to $3B cell line
- 23andMe/Ancestry.com: Multi-million dollar genetic data sales without customer compensation

## ECONOMIC IMPACT ANALYSIS

### Pharmaceutical/Biotech Industry
**Gene patent portfolio value:** $Billions
**Impact:** All patents using individual genetic material require licensing
**New costs:** Retroactive royalties + ongoing licensing fees
**Potential restructuring:** Drug pricing models, genetic data economics

### Consumer Genomics (23andMe, Ancestry.com)
**Current model:** Free DNA testing, sell data to pharma for $millions
**Impact:** Must license customer DNA for commercial use
**New model:** Revenue sharing with customers or upfront payment
**GSK-23andMe $300M deal:** Would require licensing from 10M+ customers

### Healthcare/Diagnostics
**Current model:** Patent diagnostic methods, charge patients for analysis
**Impact:** Cannot patent methods using patient DNA without license
**New model:** Patients license DNA for analysis, receive compensation

### Research Institutions
**Current model:** Use patient samples for research, patent discoveries
**Impact:** Benefit-sharing requirements (Nagoya Protocol alignment)
**New model:** Explicit consent + compensation for genetic data use

**TOTAL ESTIMATED IMPACT:** Restructuring of multi-billion dollar genetic IP economy
