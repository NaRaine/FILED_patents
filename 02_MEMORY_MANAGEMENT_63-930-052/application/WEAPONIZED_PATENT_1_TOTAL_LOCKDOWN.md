## 10. PROSECUTION STRATEGY

### Claim Structure

**Broad Independent Claims (1-5):** Cover ANY method/system/device implementing multi-tier adaptive placement
- Claim 1: Method (software)
- Claim 2: System (apparatus)
- Claim 3: Computer-readable medium
- Claim 4: Hardware device
- Claim 5: SoC/integrated circuit

**Medium Specificity (6-48):** Cover all implementation paths
- Software: kernel, userspace, driver, library, VM, container, firmware
- Hardware: ASIC, FPGA, controller variants
- Platforms: All CPU architectures × All operating systems
- Devices: All form factors and use cases
- Storage: All device types and connection methods

**Narrow Specific (49-63):** Cover key differentiating features
- Compression: All algorithms and approaches
- Placement: All scoring methods
- Thermal: Temperature-based optimization

### Defense Against Challenges

**Obviousness Rejection:**
- Experimental results prove non-obvious 8-50x improvement
- Prior art (LRU swap, zram) achieves much worse performance
- Combination of features (adaptive placement + compression + thermal) is non-obvious

**Prior Art:**
- Intel Optane: Different (byte-addressable PMEM, requires special hardware)
- Windows ReadyBoost: Different (cache only, not full memory extension)
- Linux zram: Different (single compression, no multi-tier adaptive placement)
- ZFS L2ARC: Different (filesystem cache, not memory management)

**Breadth:**
- Independent claims are very broad (cover concept itself)
- 60+ dependent claims cover every implementation variation
- Impossible to implement multi-tier adaptive placement without infringing at least one claim

Hardware implementations can be detected via:
- Device firmware inspection
- Controller behavior analysis
